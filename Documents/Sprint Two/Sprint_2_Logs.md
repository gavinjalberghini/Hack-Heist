| What did you complete since last meeting? | Gavin | Organizational tasks performed with the team. Assigned meeting dates for sprint two and work distribution. | Made design decisions for remote database and design of game information table. | Made design decisions for implementation of php database and removal of mySQLite usage in the application. | Implemented several scripts for the php interface | Accomplished all of the database tasks from sprint one but utilizing php interfaces and a mySQL remote database. Finished the app side requests so now the functionality is back to where it was at the end of sprint one. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Joseph | I have assigned issues for myself and set out progress goals for this sprint. I have installed Unity, the software we will be using to build the levels that will be placed within our app. | I cleaned up branches in preparation for the wave of work for this sprint. | I worked on my issues using Unity. I am researching how to create the foundation of the top-down 2D game. I also gathered assets to be placed that will create the mazes, and import objects for scenery and characters. | I have continued to work in unity for the creation of the game. I have worked on scripts for the player controller and interactions with the tilemaps. |  I have worked on scripts for the player controller and interactions with the other game objects. I have worked on the functional interaction between player obj and question obj. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Sinead | Documented meeting dates and times. Figured out what each team member will be working on for Sprint 2. | Documentation and added the logout button to the main menu screen. | Updated the README file to properly explain where different files can be found and worked on my other issues. | Continued working on testing and documentation. | Figured out how to log the user out of the app after 5 minutes of inactivity and continued documentation. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Austen | Successfully imported a Unity project into an existing Android Studio project. | Began level design and work on NPC sprites for the game | completed sprite work as well as doing research into how to communicate between an Unity application and an Android application | Got the camera to follow the player around the scene and began work on a dialogue system | Finished implementing a basic dialogue system |  |  |  |  |  |
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Gavin | Hopefully the sprint one meeting with the client so that issues that weren't finished can be rolled over. | Extending the local database to contain game data. | Establish the pipeline between the php and MySQL server | Finishing the php functionality and converting the app side calls into the new system | Likely will spend time outfitting the database for the game information. An important step for sprint two. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Joseph | I have many issues all tied to learning unity and creating the main functional game components. |  I have many issues all tied to learning unity and creating the main functional game components. |  I have many issues all tied to learning unity and creating the main functional game components. I create the layout of level in unity. |  I will keep creating functions necessary for the user stories to be completed. |  I will keep creating functions necessary for the user stories to be completed. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Sinead | Begin working on assigned issues for Sprint 2 and complete testing from Sprint 1. | Work on my assigned issues, including updating the README and finishing tests. | Continue documentation and working on assigned issues. | Hopefully finish the remaining three tests to get them to pass after the user is accessing another application outside of the app. | Apply the inactivity logout to each class individually and begin creating the certificate email for the user feedback. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Austen | I will look more into communicating between a Unity project and an Android Studio app, as well as working on sprites and level designs for the app. | Continue designing sprites for NPCs in the game | continue work on sprites as well as attempting to implement the method of communication between android and unity | I will finish the dialogue system for the NPCs | implement a collision system to stop the character from walking through everything |  |  |  |  |  |
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Gavin | Not currently. | Not currently. | Not currently. | Not currently. | Not an immediate roadblock but we will need to know how information can be shared with unity. (There is a backup plan if this can't happen). |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Joseph | I have two other tests during the later half of this sprint. | I have two other tests during the later half of this sprint. | I have two other tests during the later half of this sprint. | I have two other tests this week. | I have two other tests this week. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Sinead | Not currently | Not currently | Handling car problems | No | Not currently |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Austen | Nothing is currently getting in the way of my work. | Nothing is currently getting in the way of my work | not currently being able to communicate between a unity app and an android one | other responsibilities are taking up more of my work time than usual | The physics that Unity has implemented apply differently when you use screen buttons and not the keyboard |  |  |  |  |  |
| What insights have you made? | Gavin | Recently discovered that we will have a mostly encapsulated game experience in Unity. | Nothing as of yet. | Postman is a great web debug tool. | Nothing as of yet. | Php interfaces are very fragile. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Joseph | Working together is a good way to stay on it. | Working together is a good way to stay on it. | Working together is a good way to stay on it. | Working together is a good way to stay on it. | Working together is a good way to stay on it. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Sinead | We get the most work done when we meet in person. | Nothing yet. | Nothing new | Different ways in use "intended" in espresso testing. | How to time how long a user has not interacted with the game and how to start a new intent to send them back to welcome screen after being logged out. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Austen | Learning how to integrate Unity scenes into Android apps. | NPCs that don't move don't need to be animated | Sending data to a unity project running within an android app is not a simple task | Attaching a camera to an object gets it to follow that object around | Using buttons on the screen instead of the keyboard changes how other things work in Unity |  |  |  |  |  |
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Gavin | Not currently. | Not Currently | Not Currently | Not Currently | We will have to figure out how to run the app when the server is down. For dev and consumer purposes. |  |  |  |  |  |

|  | Austen | No changes currently need to be made due to my work. | No changes currently need to be made due to my work | No changes currently need to be made; however, if I cannot find an efficient mode of communication changes will need to be made. | No changes currently need to be made to the project | No changes currently need to be made to the project due to my work |  |  |  |  |  |
