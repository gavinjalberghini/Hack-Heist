| What did you complete since last meeting? | Gavin | Organizational tasks performed with the team. Assigned meeting dates for sprint two and work distribution. | Made design decisions for remote database and design of game information table. | Made design decisions for implementation of php database and removal of mySQLite usage in the application. | Implemented several scripts for the php interface | Accomplished all of the database tasks from sprint one but utilizing php interfaces and a mySQL remote database. Finished the app side requests so now the functionality is back to where it was at the end of sprint one. | Cleaned up database calls and began prep for storing game information on the db. | Worked with Austen to implement collisions that keep objects from phasing through each other. | Assisted with Unity tasks and started planning to work on Unity/Android information exchange. | Ported Unity to Android project. | Updated database, leaderboard, and implemented data reset. |
|  | Joseph | I have assigned issues for myself and set out progress goals for this sprint. I have installed Unity, the software we will be using to build the levels that will be placed within our app. | I cleaned up branches in preparation for the wave of work for this sprint. | I worked on my issues using Unity. I am researching how to create the foundation of the top-down 2D game. I also gathered assets to be placed that will create the mazes, and import objects for scenery and characters. | I have continued to work in unity for the creation of the game. I have worked on scripts for the player controller and interactions with the tilemaps. |  I have worked on scripts for the player controller and interactions with the other game objects. I have worked on the functional interaction between player obj and question obj. | I have worked on scripts for the player controller and interactions with the other game objects. I have been researching how to communicate between android studio and unity. |  I have not worked on the issues this time. I have been studying for exams. | I have worked on the inventory system for the game. | I have worked on the pause menu system | I have completed the tasks assigned to me. |
|  | Sinead | Documented meeting dates and times. Figured out what each team member will be working on for Sprint 2. | Documentation and added the logout button to the main menu screen. | Updated the README file to properly explain where different files can be found and worked on my other issues. | Continued working on testing and documentation. | Implemented logout after 5 minutes of inactivity and documentation | Documentation. Applied inactivity logout to existing activities. Began looking into how to email a certificate of completion to the user. | Figuring out how to create a certificate and started writing the Sprint 2 retrospective | Created a completion activity with button functionality | Documentation and working on the Sprint 2 retrospective | I commented the java files and am finishing the retrospective |
|  | Austen | Successfully imported a Unity project into an existing Android Studio project. | Began level design and work on NPC sprites for the game | completed sprite work as well as doing research into how to communicate between an Unity application and an Android application | Got the camera to follow the player around the scene and began work on a dialogue system | Finished implementing a basic dialogue system | Continued working on collisions between objects | Finished the collisions between objects | am continuing work on the dialogue system for questions | I have finished the questions dialogue boxes | Continuing work on communications between unity and android studio |
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Gavin | Hopefully the sprint one meeting with the client so that issues that weren't finished can be rolled over. | Extending the local database to contain game data. | Establish the pipeline between the php and MySQL server | Finishing the php functionality and converting the app side calls into the new system | Likely will spend time outfitting the database for the game information. An important step for sprint two. | Assist in figuring out how to get information to/from unity.  | Likely will spend time outfitting the database for the game information. Also likely will have Unity work to help Austen and Joseph accomplish their goals. | Porting the Unity App to the android project.  | Establish communication between unity and android projects. | Last meeting for sprint but will preform cleanup. |
|  | Joseph | I have many issues all tied to learning unity and creating the main functional game components. |  I have many issues all tied to learning unity and creating the main functional game components. |  I have many issues all tied to learning unity and creating the main functional game components.

|  | Sinead | Begin working on assigned issues for Sprint 2 and complete testing from Sprint 1. | Work on my assigned issues, including updating the README and finishing tests. | Continue documentation and working on assigned issues. | Hopefully finish the remaining three tests to get them to pass after the user is accessing another application outside of the app. | Apply inactivity logout to all activities in the menus and game | Figure out how to create a certificate of completion for the user | Work on all assigned issues, including retrospective and emailing certificate of completion | Work on my assigned issues | Work on the Sprint 2 retrospective and work on other assigned issues | Continue to document the teams' progress and plan for our final sprint |
|  | Austen | I will look more into communicating between a Unity project and an Android Studio app, as well as working on sprites and level designs for the app. | Continue designing sprites for NPCs in the game | continue work on sprites as well as attempting to implement the method of communication between android and unity | I will finish the dialogue system for the NPCs | implement a collision system to stop the character from walking through everything | I will hopefully finish the collisions before next meeting | I will start work on the dialogue system for questions | I will have the question dialogue system working and functional | I will be working on communications between the unity app and android studio | I will get communications working and get a full working level by the end of the sprint |
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Gavin | Not currently. | Not currently. | Not currently. | Not currently. | Not an immediate roadblock but we will need to know how information can be shared with unity. (There is a backup plan if this can't happen). | Not currently | Not currently | Not currently | Not currently | Not currently |

|  | Austen | Nothing is currently getting in the way of my work. | Nothing is currently getting in the way of my work | not currently being able to communicate between a unity app and an android one | other responsibilities are taking up more of my work time than usual | The physics that Unity has implemented apply differently when you use screen buttons and not the keyboard | Not being able to use Unity's built in physics engine for the collisions | Nothing currently getting in the way of my work | Trying to use the regular dialogue system for questions does not work so I have to design a new system just for questions | Nothing is currently getting in the way of my work | Nothing is currently getting in the way of my work |
| What insights have you made? | Gavin | Recently discovered that we will have a mostly encapsulated game experience in Unity. | Nothing as of yet. | Postman is a great web debug tool. | Nothing as of yet. | Php interfaces are very fragile.| Not currently | Nothing as of yet | Nothing as of yet | There is good documentation on this issue. We have spread it through our discord. | There is good documentation on this issue. We have spread it through our discord.  |

|  | Austen | Learning how to integrate Unity scenes into Android apps. | NPCs that don't move don't need to be animated | Sending data to a unity project running within an android app is not a simple task | Attaching a camera to an object gets it to follow that object around | Using buttons on the screen instead of the keyboard changes how other things work in Unity | Enough code can get anything to do what you want | There are multiple ways to move and stop an object in Unity | unity does not like 2d arrays | nothing new to share | android plugins exist and can help with communication |
