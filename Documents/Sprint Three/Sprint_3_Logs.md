| What did you complete since last meeting? | Gavin | Meeting with client and outline of work to be performed for this sprint. | Spent time researching sending information between android and unity | Some organizational tasks with Joseph and Austen on how the unity will reflect the game. | Continued work on the android app implementation for communication between android and unity.  | Worked on passing information from android to unity via method calls instead of app to app communication. | Completed passing information task between android and unity. Established a c# script that will pull the intent extras from android into the unity game. Also talked with Austen about how this will have to be implemented with the load script inside Unity so there is no race conditions when trying to ping the database.  | Spent time on organizational tasks with the team. Cleaned up Android code. | Worked with Joseph to create two 'loading' scenes in Unity that run our start up scripts. Also updated the startup scripts. | Spent some time trying to install a wamp server on Joseph's machine. However there is some communication difference between what he has and what I have. | Performed testing for project on my machine. |
|  | Joseph | I have implemented the level - to - elevator functionality of the game. | nothing this time, I had lots of other HW. | Still nothing. | I have refactored the unity design in unity more. | I have designed the layout for future levels to be built in unity. | I have finished the implementation of the Badges and keyCards. | I have spent time on the level previews | I have fixed question answering errors and Dialogue buttons (exit and continue) | I have changed layering with rodney so that he is in front of objects like the elevator and other NPC's, I also finished the button scaling issues. | level templates have been dished out. Very close to done. |
|  | Sinead | Presented with Duke. Organizational tasks for Sprint 3 and documentation | Added the Sprint 3 Logs and tentative schedule | Updated the README.md file in order to be able to find files in repo | No significant progress | Created a completion activity with a functional email certificate button | Created the certificate and working on figuring out how to attach it to an email | research why the file wont attach to the email | No significant progress | created levels content activity | Changed backgrounds files, changed logos and altered colors of fields so that they are visible - and started the Sprint 3 Retrospective |
|  | Austen | Continued implementing functionality for levels and elevator so that character can move between levels | Worked on sprite design for level NPCs | No significant progress made | Continued work on sprites for NPC characters | Finished up sprite designs for NPC characters | No. | Began implementing load and save functionality into the Unity side of the game | No significant progress has been made | Added boss sprite and fixed the dialogue and question boxes | began constructing the boss level for the game |
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Gavin | Research sending information between android and unity. |Continuing research and beginning implementation.  | Continue working on the implementation for sending information between android and unity. | Test information passing. | Test information passing. | Small stylistic clean up and assisting Austen and Joseph in Unity where needed. | There are some Unity scripts that need to be updated.  | Attempting to get a wamp server on Joseph's machine. | Attempt to diagnose the issue with Joseph's machine, and some orgizational tasking for our final meeting. | Hopefully have the finished working app. |
|  | Joseph | I will refactor the code in preparation for the mass production of levels. | I will refactor the code in preparation for the mass production of levels. | I will refactor the code in preparation for the mass production of levels. | I will be designing the layout for other levels in unity. | I will finish the badges and access cards implementation. | I will work on the  level previews feature | I will continue work on the level previews feature. | I will rework the movement button scaling on Android devices. | Now that the level template is finally completed, I will make 5 more levels just like level one, add the questions for each level with answers, and then create the mazes on the tilemaps to finish the game. | No more meetings, but I will finish up the mazes and everything else. |
|  | Sinead | Documentation and Add Sprint 3 files | Documentation and reorganizing the GitHub | Update the Sprint Logs and being research into emailing the user | Work on sending the user an email of completion | Make the email to the user more visually pleasing | Try to figure out how to attach an image to an email | finish completion email for user | create Levels Content activity | Change backgrounds of certain pages | Sprint 3 Retrospective |
|  | Austen | Continue to perfect functionality and work on making the game look better | Continue sprite design for level objects | Continue sprite and level design | Continue working on NPC Sprites as well as finishing up implementation of mechanics necessary for building levels | continue to finish up implementing the last of the game mechanics and begin level construction | continue to finish up implementing the last of the game mechanics and begin level construction | Continue implementing final functionality into the game and begin building levels | Continue implementing final functionality into the game and begin building levels | continue final mechanics and start constructing levels | Get this game as done as I can |
